   <h1>Round 1</h1>
    <p>The favourites were in full command in the first round, and a total of 72 teams scored 4–0 victories. Amongst the favourites, Georgia, Poland and China whitewashed their opponents. Defending champions Ukraine and the top seeds India conceded a half point after former Women's World Champion Anna Ushenina was held to a draw by Kyrzgyzstan's Alexandra Samaganova on the top board and India's Vantika Agrawal split the point with Jamaica's Raehanna Brown in a queen endgame on board three.[17][18][19] The highest-rated player in the tournament Nana Dzagnidze did not play in this round,[19] but her team was one of the first to finish the day with four convincing wins. Lela Javakhishvili played a 20-move miniature in the London System that ended with a checkmate (see diagram).[18][20]</p>
    <h1>Round 2</h1>
    <p>There were no major upsets in the second round and a total of 41 teams scored victories in the opening two matches. Poland, China, Spain and Armenia scored their second 4–0 victories, while India, Hungary, United States, Bulgaria and France dropped a half point against Czech Republic, Ecuador, Philippines, Egypt and Luxembourg, respectively.[21] Georgia defeated Montenegro 3–1 thanks to wins by Nana Dzagnidze, Nino Batsiashvili and Bella Khotenashvili on the first three boards, but Nikolina Koljević scored an upset win with the Black pieces over Salome Melia on the lowest board after the Georgian misplayed the position with a space-gaining pawn push.[22][23][21]

        
        Ukraine were one of the top-seeded teams that struggled the most in this round, but finally they managed to edge out Lithuania with a 2½–1½ scoreline. On the top board, Yuliia Osmak lost her game as White to Olena Martynkova, and Evgeniya Doluhanova drew against Gabija Šimkūnaitė on the lowest board. Martynkova fought back from a worse position to implement tactics by sacrificing a piece that led her to a winning position (see diagram).[21][24] However, the Ukrainian team snatched the match victory with wins scored by Nataliya Buksa and Inna Gaponenko on the middle boards.[22][23] Another close match was Kazakhstan's minimal victory over Finland in which Finnish player Lauri Bederdin beat Alua Nurman and Anastasia Nazarova drew against Bibisara Assaubayeva on board one.[21] The biggest surprise in this round was perhaps Singapore's 2½–1½ victory over Latvia thanks to wins scored by Kay Yan Eden Pang and Kun Fang both with the Black pieces.[25]</p>
        <h1 id="round3">Round 3</h1>
        <p>The third round saw the first upsets involving top-seeded teams. Georgia were held to a draw by Romania in a match wherein Nana Dzagnidze and Nino Batsiashvili defeated Irina Bulmaga and Carmen Voicu-Jagodzinsky on the first and third boards, respectively, to score full points for the Georgian team, but the Romanian players were victorious on the other boards. Mihaela Sandu caught Lela Javakhishvili in a mating net in the endgame, while Bella Khotenashvili blundered a mate in two against Alessia-Mihaela Ciolacu (see diagram).[26] Poland and Greece tied with one per side. Ekaterini Pavlidou won a roller-coaster game against Aleksandra Maltsevskaya with the three queens on the board and the black king on d3, whereas the best player at the previous Olympiad Oliwia Kiołbasa beat Marina Makropoulou to score a full point for the Polish team.[27] Neverhteless, the biggest upset in this round was perhaps Uzbekistan's victory over the host country Hungary with a 2½–1½ scoreline. Afruza Khamdamova benefited from Zsóka Gaál's blunder in a pure rook endgame to win a full point on the top board, while Umida Omonova also triumphed as Black on the third board.[28]

        
    Of the top-seeded teams, India, China and Ukraine did not have problems in this round. India defeated Switzerland 3–1. Alexandra Kosteniuk scored for the Swiss team against Harika Dronavalli on board one, but all other games finished in favour of the Indian players. On the second board, Vaishali Rameshbabu entered into a same-colour bishop endgame that she managed to convert due to the king's superior activity despite the material parity.[29] Divya Deshmukh scored her third victory in the tournament by checkmating Sofiia Hryzlova with a pawn on board three.[28]</p
